### Sepsis Prediction 

## Overview  
This dataset is a modified version of a publicly available data source, designed for use in a sepsis prediction project. The primary goal is to predict whether ICU patients will develop sepsis based on clinical and demographic data. This dataset is for academic purposes only and is subject to usage restrictions as outlined in the license agreement.
